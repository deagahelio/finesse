# finesse
One-key finesse macro for JStris

## Usage

Set JStris key bindings to default and change these:

- Rotate Left: `[`
- Rotate Right: `]`
- Rotate 180: `'`
- Hold: `shift`

Then change the hotkeys in `finesse.au3` to match your keyboard layout.

## Controls

The key bindings are the same as the inverted 40-key control scheme from Keyblox:

- Number row: 180 rot
- Upper row: CW rot
- Home row: inital rot
- Lower row: CCW rot

The placement is left-aligned.
